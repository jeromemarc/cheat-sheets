= Advanced Linux Commands Cheat Sheet
:experimental: true
:product-name:
:version: 1.0.0

This cheat sheet presents a collection of Linux commands and shows how they are used by developers in advanced programming scenarios. The commands are organized by category.

== Application management commands

Commands in this section apply to advanced operations when working with a computer's applications and executables. 

=== systemctl

`systemctl [options] <subcommand>`

Used to inspect and control the state of the `systemd` suite of Linux system components.

*Examples:*

This example shows the invocation and result of a `systemctl status` command set that discovers the status of the Apache web server (note that `$` is the command-line prompt symbol):

```
$ systemctl status httpd
● httpd.service - The Apache HTTP Server
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service; disabled; vendor preset: disable>
   Active: inactive (dead)
     Docs: man:httpd.service(8)
```

This example shows the invocation of the `systemctl start` command set that starts the `mariadb` database:

`systemctl start mariadb`

This example shows the invocation of the `systemctl enable` command set so that an application starts automatically when the computer reboots:

`systemctl enable mariadb`


=== yum

The application installation and removal tool for Fedora, CentOS, and RHEL.

*Example:*

The following command installs the `net-tools` application, which has many handy utilities such as `netstat`:

`sudo yum -y install net-tools`


== Audit commands

The commands in this section are used to work with the audit capabilities provided by the Linux operating system. 

=== ausearch

`ausearch [options] <application/process>`

Used to query the audit logs according to events defined by different search criteria.

*Example:*

The following example shows how to use `ausearch` to get information about the user named `root` from the audit logs. The  option `-ui` indicates that the search should be conducted according to a particular user ID, in this case `root`. The result is piped to the `more` command that uses the option `-10`, which indicates to show the first 10 lines of output.

Note that the `ausearch` command must be invoked as `sudo` in order to access audit logs:

```
$ sudo ausearch -ui root | more -10

== Disk management commands

Commands in this section apply to working with disks, devices, and volumes on a computer running the Linux operating system. 

=== df

`df [options] <file name>`

Shows the amount of disk space used and available according to the file system that represents a particular disk device mount. If no file name is given, the space available on all mounted file systems is displayed.

*Example:*

The following example shows the invocation and result of `df` displaying all mounted file systems. Disk space  is  shown in  1K blocks:

```
$ df
Filesystem            1K-blocks    Used Available Use% Mounted on
devtmpfs                3949180       0   3949180   0% /dev
tmpfs                   3978636       0   3978636   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs                   3978636    9464   3969172   1% /run
tmpfs                   3978636       0   3978636   0% /sys/fs/cgroup

tmpfs                    795724      64    795660   1% /run/user/1000
```

=== fdisk

Used for working with disk partitions on a computer's hard drive. You can use `fdisk` to format and partition a new drive. Also, you can use `fdisk` to get information about existing drives.

*Examples:*

This example invokes `fdisk` to display a print out of partition tables of all devices on the computer, as listed in the `/proc/partitions` file:

```
$ sudo fdisk -l
Disk /dev/sda: 80 GiB, 85899345920 bytes, 167772160 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0x565c4e2e

Device     Boot   Start       End   Sectors Size Id Type
/dev/sda1  *       2048   2099199   2097152   1G 83 Linux
/dev/sda2       2099200 167772159 165672960  79G 8e Linux LVM

Disk /dev/mapper/rhel-root: 47.8 GiB, 51292143616 bytes, 100179968 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes

Disk /dev/mapper/rhel-swap: 7.9 GiB, 8485076992 bytes, 16572416 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes

Disk /dev/mapper/rhel-home: 23.3 GiB, 25044189184 bytes, 48914432 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
```

This example uses `fdisk` to start the process of formatting and partitioning a drive at `/dev/sda1`. This invocation of `fdisk` will open a dialog in the terminal window that walks the developer through the formatting and partitioning process:

```
fdisk /dev/sda1
```

*Note:* Using `fdisk` in this manner erases all data on the disk.

=== mount

`mount [options] <device_directory>``

Shows or attaches a device filesystem to a Linux operating system's master file tree.

*Examples:*

This example shows the `mount` command using the `-l` option to list all mounted file systems. The result of `mount` is piped to the `more` command. The `more` command uses the `-10` option to display the first 10 lines of output:

```
$ mount -l | more -10
sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,seclabel)
proc on /proc type proc (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)
devtmpfs on /dev type devtmpfs (rw,nosuid,seclabel,size=3949180k,nr_inodes=987295,mode=755)
securityfs on /sys/kernel/security type securityfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)
tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,seclabel)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,nosuid,noexec,relatime,seclabel,gid=5,mode=620,ptmxmode=000)
tmpfs on /run type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,seclabel,mode=755)
tmpfs on /sys/fs/cgroup type tmpfs (ro,nosuid,nodev,noexec,seclabel,mode=755)
cgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,seclabel,xattr,release_agent=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-cgroups-ag
ent,name=systemd)
--More--
```

This example uses the `mount` command to mount the file system for a hard drive that is represented as `/dev/sda1`:

```
$ sudo mount /dev/sda1
```

===  xfs_repair

`xfs_repair [options] <drive>`

Inspects and optionally repairs a hard drive on a computer running RHEL Linux.


*Note:* You must unmount the drive using the `umount` command before invoking `xfs_repair`.

*Example:*

The following example unmounts a hard drive at `/dev/sda1` and then runs the command `xfs_repair` against that drive:

```
$ sudo umount /dev/sda1

$ sudo xfs_repair /dev/sda1
Phase 1 - find and verify superblock...
Phase 2 - using internal log
        - zero log...
        - scan filesystem freespace and inode maps...

        - agno = 2
        - agno = 3
        - process newly discovered inodes...
Phase 4 - check for duplicate blocks...
        - setting up duplicate extent list...

Phase 7 - verify and correct link counts...
done

```
== File management commands

Commands in this section apply to working with files and directories on a computer running the Linux operating system.

=== chmod

`chmod [options] <file or directory>`

Changes the permissions granted to a file or directory.

*Examples:*

This example applies read-only permissions for all users to the file named `sample.txt`. Then, the command `ls -l` is executed to verify that the file is indeed read-only. The output is also displayed:

```
$ chmod a-w+r sample.txt
$ ls -l sample.txt
-r--r--r--. 1 guest guest 32 Jan 17 10:34 sample.txt
```

This example applies read and write permissions for all users to the file named `sample.txt`. Then, the command `ls -l` is executed to verify that the file is indeed read-only. The output is also displayed:

```
$ chmod a+w+r sample.txt
$ ls -l sample.txt
-rw-rw-rw-. 1 guest guest 32 Jan 17 10:34 sample.txt
```
=== chown

`chown [options] <owner><:<:<group>> <file>`

Changes the owner of a file according to user and/or group.

*Example:*

This example lists the files in the current directory by using the `ls -l` command and option to display details about the files, including the  user: group pair that owns each file. Then, the owner of the file `two.txt` is changed using the `chown` command, assigning the user named `lennonjohn` who is in the group `beatles` as the new file owner.

The result of the change in file ownership is displayed using the command `ls` with the option `-l` again:

```
$ ls -l
total 0
-rw-rw-r--. 1 guest guest 0 Jan 19 10:17 one.txt
-rw-rw-r--. 1 guest guest 0 Jan 19 10:18 three.txt
-rw-rw-r--. 1 guest guest 0 Jan 19 10:17 two.txt

$ sudo chown lennonjohn:beatles two.txt

$ ls -l
total 0
-rw-rw-r--. 1 guest   guest 0 Jan 19 10:17 one.txt
-rw-rw-r--. 1 guest   guest 0 Jan 19 10:18 three.txt
-rw-rw-r--. 1 lennonjohn beatles  0 Jan 19 10:17 two.txt


```

== Job commands


Commands in this section apply to working with jobs running under the Linux operating system. A _job_ is a process that is invoked from a terminal window process and is considered a child of the terminal window.

=== bg

`bg<job_id>`

Sends a job to the background.

*Example:*

The following example creates a bash script named `demo.sh` that outputs the string `hi there` to the console and then sleeps for two seconds. The bash script is invoked as a foreground job.

Then, the foreground job is stopped by striking the `ctrl+Z` keys. The job is started again in the background using the `bg` command along with the job id `%1`:


```
$ echo "while true; do echo hi there; sleep 2; done" > demo.sh
$ sh demo.sh
hi there
hi there
hi there
^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 sh demo.sh
$ bg %1
[1]+ sh demo.sh &
```

=== fg

`fg <job_id>`

Sends a job to the foreground.

*Example:*

The following example creates a bash script named `demo.sh` that outputs the string `hi there` to the console and then sleeps for two seconds. The script is invoked as a job.

Then, the foreground job is stopped by striking the `ctrl+Z` keys. The job is started again in the foreground using the `fg` command, along with the job id `%1`:

```
$ echo "while true; do echo hi there; sleep 2; done" > demo.sh
$ sh demo.sh
hi there
hi there
hi there
^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 sh demo.sh
$ fg %1
sh demo.sh
```
=== jobs

`jobs [options]`

Lists the jobs invoked from the process window

*Example:*

The following example uses the `jobs` command to list all the jobs and the status of jobs that were started from the current terminal window. Notice that there are three jobs in force. All the jobs are running the same bash script named `demo.sh`. Jobs %1 and %3 are stopped. Job %2 is running in the background, as denoted by the symbol `&`:

```
$ jobs -l
[1]+  6265 Stopped                 sh demo.sh
[2]   6262 Running                 sh demo.sh &
[3]+  6265 Stopped                 sh demo.sh
```

== Memory management commands

The following command applies to working with memory on a computer running the Linux operating system.

=== free

This command reports information about memory status on the local computer or virtual machine.

*Example:*

The following example invokes the `free` command with the `-w` option. The `-w` option reports additional information about memory status:

```
$ free -w
              total        used        free      shared     buffers       cache   available
Mem:        7957276     1653404     4563456       35032        4320     1736096     5965440
Swap:       8286204           0     8286204
```

== Network commands

Commands in this section apply to working with or on a network.

=== curl

`curl [options] <url>`

Gets or posts a file to or from the Internet according to a URL.

*Examples:*

This example downloads a web page from the Red Hat Developer website implementing the `-o` option to save the page to the file named `article.html`:

```
$ curl https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/01/11/5-design-principles-microservices -o article.html
```

This example uses the `curl` command to upload a file named `data.txt` to the URL `https://example.com/api/data`. Notice the use of the `-X` option to tell `curl` to use the HTTP POST method, the `-H` option to set the content type header in the request, and the `-d` option to define the file to upload:

```
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d "data.txt" https://example.com/api/data
```

=== host

`host [options] <domain_name>`

Reports information about a given domain name.

*Example:*

The following example uses `host` to report the default information about the domain name `redhat.com`:

```
$ host redhat.com
redhat.com has address 209.132.183.105
redhat.com mail is handled by 10 us-smtp-inbound-1.mimecast.com.
redhat.com mail is handled by 10 us-smtp-inbound-2.mimecast.com.
```

=== hostname

`hostname`

Sets or gets the hostname of the computer or virtual machine.

*Examples:*

This example displays the current hostname of the machine:

```
$ hostname
localhost.localdomain
```

This example renames the current hostname of the machine to `newhostname.localdomain` and then verifies the current hostname of the machine:

```
$ sudo hostname newhostname.localdomain
$ hostname
newhostname.localdomain
```

=== hostnamectl

`hostnamectl [options] <command>`

The command `hostnamectl` is similar to the command `hostname` but with added capabilities. 

*Example:*

The following example invokes and displays the result of the `hostnamectl status` command set to report the hostname and additional information:

```
$ hostnamectl status
   Static hostname: localhost.localdomain
Transient hostname: tempvm.localdomain
         Icon name: computer-vm
           Chassis: vm
        Machine ID: 7080e8d7b18547fa90aa06416ce6a1cf
           Boot ID: 7d0c3ed3f773457a8045602e66e2581f
    Virtualization: oracle
  Operating System: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.5 (Ootpa)
       CPE OS Name: cpe:/o:redhat:enterprise_linux:8::baseos
            Kernel: Linux 4.18.0-348.el8.x86_64
      Architecture: x86-64
```

=== iptables

`iptables [options]`

Sets and monitors network access to a given computer.

*Note:* The command `iptables` must be run with administrator permissions under `sudo`.

*Examples:*

This example allows incoming TCP traffic accessing the computer via port 22:

```
$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
```

This example rejects any network traffic coming in from a computer running from the IP address `192.168.86.11`:

```
$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.86.11 -j DROP
```

=== nmcli

`nmcli [options] <object> <command>`

The application `nmcli` is the command-line interface for working with the Linux NetworkManager.

*Examples:*

This example uses `nmcli` to display the overall connection status of the computer using the `general` object and the `status` command:

```
$ nmcli general status
STATE      CONNECTIVITY  WIFI-HW  WIFI     WWAN-HW  WWAN    
connected  full          enabled  enabled  enabled  enabled 
```

This example uses `nmcli` to display the connection status of the network interface devices using the `device` object and the `status` command:

```
$ sudo nmcli device status
DEVICE      TYPE      STATE                   CONNECTION 
enp0s3      ethernet  connected               enp0s3 
```

This example uses `nmcli` to display the connection profiles of network devices on a computer in a report-like format by using the option `-p` (pretty) against the `connection` object:

```
$ nmcli -p connection
======================================
  NetworkManager connection profiles
======================================
NAME    UUID                                  TYPE      DEVICE

virbr0  49bf2d57-cf45-41a8-85d2-cd43a59f0e1c  bridge    virbr0 
```

== Process commands

Commands in this section apply to working with Linux processes from the command line.

=== &&

`<command> && <command>`

Executes commands in a sequence.

*Example:*

The following command changes the current directory to `/etc`, then executes the command `ls` to list the contents of the directory:

```
$ cd /etc && ls
```

=== iotop

`iotop [options]`

`iotop` is a system monitoring program. It does not ship by default with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and must must be installed using the command set `sudo yum install itop`.

Note that this command requires administrator access and must be invoked as `sudo`.

*Example:*

The following example shows how to invoke `iotop` to read system IO. A portion of the output is displayed:

```
$ sudo iotop

`ps [options]`

Displays the status of current processes.

*Example:*

The following example invokes the `ps` command with the options `aux` to display every process on the system. The result of the invocation is piped to the `more` command using the `-10` to display the first 10 lines of results for stdout:

```
$ ps aux | more -10

== SELinux management commands

Commands in this section apply to working with Red Hat's Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux), which provides an additional layer of system security. SELinux fundamentally answers the question: "May <subject> do <action> to <object>." For example: "May a web server access files in users' home directories?"

=== getenforce

`getenforce`

Reports the current mode of SELinux rules enforcement. The modes are `Enforcing`, `Permissive`, or `Disabled`.

*Example:*

The following example invokes the command `getenforce` along with the results:

```
$ getenforce
Enforcing
```

=== getsebool

`getsebool [-a] <boolean_value>`

Reports whether an applicable SELinux setting is `on` or `off`. Use the `-a` option to show the boolean value of all settings.

*Examples:*

This example use `getsebool` to show the value of the SELinux setting `virt_use_xserver`:

```
$ getsebool virt_use_xserver
virt_use_xserver --> off
```

This example use `getsebool` along with piping the result to the `grep` and then `more` commands to show all SELinux settings that have the value `on`. The `more` command uses the `-10` option to show the first 10 lines of output:

```
$ getsebool -a | grep "on$" | more -10
abrt_upload_watch_anon_write --> on
auditadm_exec_content --> on
boinc_execmem --> on
cron_userdomain_transition --> on
dbadm_exec_content --> on
domain_fd_use --> on
entropyd_use_audio --> on
fips_mode --> on
gssd_read_tmp --> on
guest_exec_content --> on
--More--
```

=== restorecon

`restorecon [options] </path/to/dirctory_or_filename>`

Used to set the security context (extended SELinux file labels) on one or more files to the default setting.

*Example:*

The following example uses `restorecon` to restore the default labels on all files under the directory `/var/www/html`. The option `-F` is used to force a change. The option `v` will show changes in a file's labels. The option `-R` implements execution of the command recursively through all subordinate directories and files from the directory where the command is invoked:

```
$ restorecon -FvR /var/www/html
```

=== semanage

`semanage <object> [options]`

Allows administrators to manage SELinux capabilities according to the particular object of interest. Each object will have its own set of options. Examples of `semanage` objects are `user`, `login`, `port`, and `fcontext`, to name a few.

Note that this command must be invoked as `sudo`.

Also note that the `semanage` program does not ship with SELinux by default: You must install the `policycoreutils-python` package with `yum` to get the `semanage` command.

*Examples:*

This example uses `semanage` to get the security settings for the `user` objects. The `-l` option is used to list the information for all users:

```
$ sudo semanage user -l

                Labeling   MLS/       MLS/                          
SELinux User    Prefix     MCS Level  MCS Range                      SELinux Roles

guest_u         user       s0         s0                             guest_r
root            user       s0         s0-s0:c0.c1023                 staff_r sysadm_r system_r unconfined_r
staff_u         user       s0         s0-s0:c0.c1023                 staff_r sysadm_r unconfined_r
sysadm_u        user       s0         s0-s0:c0.c1023                 sysadm_r
system_u        user       s0         s0-s0:c0.c1023                 system_r unconfined_r
unconfined_u    user       s0         s0-s0:c0.c1023                 system_r unconfined_r
user_u          user       s0         s0                             user_r
xguest_u        user       s0         s0                             xguest_r
```

This example uses `semanage` to view a list of login information:

```
$ sudo semanage login -l

Login Name           SELinux User         MLS/MCS Range        Service

__default__          unconfined_u         s0-s0:c0.c1023       *
root                 unconfined_u         s0-s0:c0.c1023       *
```

=== setsebool

`setsebool <setting> <value>`

Applies a boolean value to an SELinux setting.

*Example:*

The following example uses `setsebool` to apply the value `1` (`true`) to the SELinux setting `httpd_can_network_connect_db`:

```
$ setsebool httpd_can_network_connect_db 1
```

=== subscription-manager

`subscription-manager <command> [options]`

The `subscription-manager` is the command-line version of the graphical Red Hat Enterprise Linux Subscription Manager. Subscription Manager is a service that keeps track of the Red Hat products and subscriptions installed on a local computer. Subscription Manager communicates with the subscription service on the backend. Typically, backend settings are managed via the Customer Portal or an on-premise server such as Subscription Asset Manager. Subscription Manager works with content management tools such as `yum`.

The command `subscription-manager` will run as the root user; thus, a password prompt will be presented upon invocation.

*Example:*

The following example uses the `subscription-manager facts` command set to get facts about the local computer. The command pipes the result to the `more` command, which in turn uses the `-15` option to display the first 15 lines of output.

```
$ sudo subscription-manager facts | more -15

== System information commands

Commands in this section provide memory and hardware information about the computer in which the given command is invoked.

=== lscpu

`lscpu [options]`

Displays information about the CPU architecture on the given machine.

When `lscpu` is run on a virtual machine, the CPU architecture information reported reflects the configuration of the guest  operating system, which is typically different from the operating system on the host computer.

This command is part of the `util-linux` package, which you can install using the command: `sudo yum install -y util-linux`. In some cases, the package is part of the operating system's default installation.

*Example:*

The following example uses `lscpu` with the `--json` option to display CPU architecture information about a virtual machine in JSON format:

```
$ lscpu --json
