= Linux Commands Cheat Sheet
:experimental: true
:product-name:
:version: 1.0.0

This cheat sheet presents a list of command-line executables that are frequently used by developers working on a computer running the Linux operating system. The commands are organized by category.

== Application management commands

Commands in this section apply to working with a computer's applications and executables.  

=== which

`which <command>`

Describes the location of an application in the computer's file system. If an application is not installed on the computer and its parent directory is not part of the system's `$PATH`, `which` will report an error.

*Example:*

The following example invokes the `which` command against the command `clear` and shows the result of the `which` command:

```
$ which clear
/usr/bin/clear 
```

=== yum

`yum`

The application installation and removal tool for Fedora, CentOS, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

*Example:*

The following command installs the `net-tools` application, which has many handy utilities such as `netstat`:

`sudo yum -y install net-tools`

== Console and output management commands

Commands in this section apply to working with data sent to stdout or displayed in a computer's terminal window. 

=== cat

`cat <path/to/filename>` 

Displays the contents of `<path/to/filename>` to standard out.

*Example:*

The following command displays the contents of the system-release file that describes the version of RHEL, CentOS, or Fedora that's running (`$` is the command-prompt symbol):

```
$ cat /etc/system-release
Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 8.5 (Ootpa)
```

=== clear

Clears the terminal screen.

*Example:*

```
$ clear
```

=== echo

`echo <string>` 

Displays a string to stdout or to a file.

*Examples:*

This example demonstrates how to invoke `echo` to display a string in the console:

```
$ echo "Hello World"
Hello World
```

This example demonstrates how to invoke `echo` and save the output to a file named `data.txt`:

```
$ echo "Hello World" > data.txt
```

=== top
`top [options]` 

Displays information about the running Linux processes.

*Example:*

The following command displays the `top` command with the result piped to the `more` command in order to view the first portion of the output:


```
$ top | more

--More--
```

== Environment variables commands

Commands in this section apply to working with a Linux computer's environment variables.

=== env

`env`

Displays all environment variables running on the system. 

*Example:*

The following example invokes `env` to get a system's environment variables and then pipes the result to the `more` command to show a portion of the environment variables (note that the environment variable LS_COLORS has been omitted because its value is quite lengthy):

```
$ env | more
SSH_CONNECTION=192.168.86.20 54276 192.168.86.34 22
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
HISTCONTROL=ignoredups
HOSTNAME=localhost.localdomain
which_declare=declare -f
XDG_SESSION_ID=11
USER=reselbob
SELINUX_ROLE_REQUESTED=
PWD=/home/reselbob
SSH_ASKPASS=/usr/libexec/openssh/gnome-ssh-askpass
HOME=/home/reselbob
SSH_CLIENT=192.168.86.20 54276 22
--More--
```

=== export

`export <env var name>=<env var value>` 

Creates an environment variable with a value and then exports the environment variable or value pair to the system.

*Example:*

The following command creates an environment variable named `WEB_PAGE` and sets the value to `https://www.redhat.com/en`. The `echo` command confirms the value of the environment variable:


```
$ export WEB_PAGE="https://www.redhat.com/en"
$ echo $WEB_PAGE
https://www.redhat.com/en
```

=== printenv

`printenv <environment_variable_name>`

Prints a particular environment variable to the console.

*Example:*

The following example uses `printenv` to print the value of the environment variable `HOSTNAME` and then displays the result:

```
$ printenv HOSTNAME
localhost.localdomain
```

=== source

`source </path/to/filename>` 

Executes commands stored in a file from within the current shell, and can also be used to refresh environment variables. 

By default a new shell is launched to run a script. Therefore, changes to environment variables are not visible in the current shell.

*Example:*

The following example uses the `cat` command to create a file named `new_vars.sh`. The file contains an `export` instruction set for the environment variable `ALT_USER=barry`. Then, the `source` command is called to set the environment variable into the system. The  `echo` command verifies that the environment variable `ALT_USER` is in force:

```
$ cat <<EOF > new_vars.sh
> #!/bin/bash
> export ALT_USER=barry
> EOF
$ source ./new_vars.sh
$ echo $ALT_USER
barry

```

== File and directory management

Commands in this section apply to working with the files and directories on Linux computers.

=== cd

`cd </path/to/directory>`

Change to another current directory.

*Example:*

The following example changes the current directory to the user's home directory:

`cd ~/`

=== cp

`cp </path/to/source/filename> </path/to/target/filename>`

Copies the contents of the source directory or file to a target directory or file.

*Example:*

The following example copies the contents of the file `helloworld.txt` to the file named `helloworld.bak`. It then executes the `cat` command to verify that the file and its contents have been copied:

```
$ cp helloworld.txt helloworld.bak
$ cat helloworld.bak 
Hello World!
```

=== find

`sudo find <starting/directory> -name <file/directory name>`

Finds a file or directory by name.

*Example:*

The following command finds a file named `hostname` starting from the root (`/`) directory of the computer's file system. Note that the command starts with `sudo` in order to access files restricted to the `root` user:

```
$ sudo find / -name hostname
/proc/sys/kernel/hostname
/etc/hostname
/var/lib/selinux/targeted/active/modules/100/hostname
/usr/bin/hostname
/usr/lib64/gettext/hostname
/usr/share/licenses/hostname
/usr/share/doc/hostname
/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/hostname
/usr/share/selinux/targeted/default/active/modules/100/hostname
/usr/libexec/hostname
```

=== grep

`grep <search_expression> <input>`

Searches plain-text input from a file or stdout according according to a regular expression.

*Example:*

The following example searches the file `/etc/password` for lines that have the string `ftp`:

```
$ grep ftp /etc/passwd
ftp:x:14:50:FTP User:/var/ftp:/sbin/nologin
```

=== head

`head </path/to/filename>`

Outputs the first part of a file (the first 10 lines).

*Example:*

The following example uses the command `head` to output the first 10 lines of the file `~/.bashrc`:

```
$ head ~/.bashrc
# .bashrc

# Source global definitions
if [ -f /etc/bashrc ]; then
	. /etc/bashrc
fi

# User specific environment
if ! [[ "$PATH" =~ "$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin:" ]]
then
```

=== less

`less [options] </path/to/filename>`

Allows you to view and navigate the contents of a plain text file or stdout in a controlled manner. Once you open a file using `less`, you can navigate the file using the following keystrokes:

* Scroll forward: `Ctrl-f`
* Scroll backward: `Ctrl-b`
* End of file: `G`
* Quit less: `q`

*Example:*

The following example uses the `less` command to open file `~/.bashrc`, and to display the file with line numbers using the option `-N`:

```
$ less -N ~/.bashrc
```

Here's the result:

```
1 # .bashrc
2 
3 # Source global definitions
4 if [ -f /etc/bashrc ]; then
5         . /etc/bashrc
6 fi
7 
8 # User specific environment
9 if ! [[ "$PATH" =~ "$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin:" ]]
10 then
11     PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin:$PATH"
12 fi
13 export PATH
14 
15 # Uncomment the following line if you don't like systemctl's auto-paging feature:
16 # export SYSTEMD_PAGER=
17 
18 # User specific aliases and functions
19 PS1="$ "
```

=== ls

`ls [options] </path/to/directory>`

Lists the contents of a directory. Defaults to the current directory.

*Examples:*

This example shows how to list all the directories in the current directory:

```
$ ls 
code  docs  images
```

This example lists all the files and directories in the current directory using the option `-l` which denotes a long listing view of the output:

```
$ ls -l
total 0
drwxrwxr-x. 2 guest guest  6 Jan 12 11:33 code
drwxrwxr-x. 2 guest guest 25 Jan 12 11:37 docs
drwxrwxr-x. 2 guest guest  6 Jan 12 11:34 images
```

This example lists all the files and directories in the current directory along with the hidden files, using the long listing option `-l` and the show-hidden-files option `-a`:

```
$ ls -la
total 4
drwxrwxr-x. 5 guest guest 60 Jan 12 11:36 .
drwxr-xr-x. 3 guest guest 68 Jan 12 11:33 ..
drwxrwxr-x. 2 guest guest  6 Jan 12 11:33 code
drwxrwxr-x. 2 guest guest 25 Jan 12 11:37 docs
drwxrwxr-x. 2 guest guest  6 Jan 12 11:34 images
-rw-rw-r--. 1 guest guest 15 Jan 12 11:36 .secrets
```

This example lists all the files and directories in the subdirectory named `docs` using the long listing option `-l`:

```
$ ls -l docs
total 4
drwxrwxr-x. 2 guest guest  6 Jan 12 11:44 drafts
-rw-rw-r--. 1 guest guest 49 Jan 12 11:37 hithere.txt
-rw-rw-r--. 1 guest guest  0 Jan 12 11:45 notes.txt
```

=== mkdir

`cd <directory_name>`

Creates a directory.

*Example:*

Creates a new directory named `documents` in the user's home directory:

`mkdir ~/documents`

=== more

`more [options] </path/to/filename or stdout>`

Allows a user to view and traverse the content of a file or stdout. The command `more` invokes itself within a distinct command-line user interface. To exit the process users strike the `q` key.

*Examples:*

This example uses the `more` command to display the first four lines of the file `/etc/passwd`. Users can then traverse the rest of the file one line at time by striking the `<ENTER>` key:

```
$ more -4 /etc/passwd 
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin
daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin
adm:x:3:4:adm:/var/adm:/sbin/nologin
--More--(5%)
```

This example illustrates using the `more` command to process stdout data. The example pipes the result of running `ls` against the directory `/etc`. The command `more` displays the first four lines of the output from stdout as declared in the option `-4`. Users can traverse through the rest of stdout a line at time by striking the `<ENTER>` key:

```
$ ls /etc | more -4
accountsservice
adjtime
aliases
alsa
--More--
```

=== mv

`mv <source file/directory> <target file/directory>`

Moves a file or directory. The `mv` command transfers all the contents from the source file or directory to the new location.

*Examples:*

This example moves the directory `documents` to the directory `docs-bak`. When `move` is invoked, the source directory will be renamed `docs-bak`:

`mv ./documents ./docs-bak`

This example moves the contents of the file `hithere.txt` in the directory `documents` to a file named `new_hithere.txt` in the same directory:

`mv ./documents/hithere.txt ./documents/new_hithere.txt`

=== pwd

`pwd`

Displays the name of the present working directory.

*Example:*

The following example displays the invocation and result of using the command `pwd` in the `HOME` directory for a user named `guest`:

```
$ pwd
/home/guest
```

=== rm

`rm [options] <file or directory>`

Removes a file or directory.

*Examples:*

This example removes the file named `hithere.txt` from the current directory (`$` indicates the command-line prompt):

```
$ rm hithere.txt
```

This example removes the directory named `documents` along with all the files and subdirectories. The options `-rf` **f**orce the removal **r**ecursively:

```
$ rm -rf ./documents
```
=== tar

`tar [options] <archive filename> <file or directory to be compressed>`

Compresses and decompresses files or directories.

*Examples:*

This example compresses a directory named `documents`, shows the output of the `tar` command, and then invokes the `ls` command to list the contents of the current directory:

```
$ tar cvzf docs.tar.gz documents/
documents/
documents/1.txt
documents/2.txt
documents/3.txt
documents/4.txt

$ ls
docs.tar.gz  documents
```

This example extracts the contents of the compressed file `docs.tar.gz` into an existing directory named `new-docs`:

```
$ tar -xvf docs.tar.gz -C  ./new-docs
```

== Help commands

The command in this section applies to working with the command-line help documentation provided on a Linux  computer.

=== man

`man <path/to/command>`

Displays the internal help documentation for a given command.

*Example:*

The following example shows how to display the command-line help documentation for the command `cp`:

```
$ man cp
```

== Network commands

Commands in this section apply to working with networks on and from a Linux computer.

=== curl

`curl [options] <url>`

Gets or posts a file to or from the Internet according to a URL.

*Examples:*

This example downloads a web page from the Red Hat Developer website and implements the `-o` option to save the page to the file `article.html`:

```
$ curl https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/01/11/5-design-principles-microservices -o article.html
```

This example uses the `curl` command to upload a file named `data.txt` to the URL `https://example.com/api/data`. Notice the use of the `-X` option to tell `curl` to use the HTTP POST method, the `-H` option to set the content type header in the request, and the `-d` option to define the file to upload:

```
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d "data.txt" https://example.com/api/data
```

=== ip

`ip [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }`

Gets the IP information for the physical or virtual machine.

*Example:*

The following example returns the IP address information associated with network interfaces on the current machine:

```
$ ip addr
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00

    link/ether 52:54:00:f7:2c:71 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```

=== netstat

`netstat  [options]`

Displays information about network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships.

*Example:*

The following example uses `netstat` to list the status of ports and the process using the particular port:

```
$ sudo netstat -anp | grep tcp
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:111             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1/systemd

```

=== ssh

`ssh [options] <ip_address>`

Secure shell is an encrypted network protocol that provides remote login and command execution capabilities. On Windows, you would use `PuTTY` and `WinSCP`. A `ssh.exe` is also available via Cygwin, as well as with a Git installation.

*Example:*

The following example shows how to use `ssh` to log in to a remote computer that has the IP address `192.168.86.11`:

```
$ ssh 192.168.86.11
```

=== wget

`wget [options] <url>`

Downloads files from the Internet. Supports the HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols. You can use `wget` as an alternative to `curl`.

*Example:*

The following example uses the `wget` command to download a file from the URL https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/01/11/5-design-principles-microservices, then uses the `-o` option to save the content to a file named `article.html`:

```
$ wget https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/01/11/5-design-principles-microservices -o article.html
```

== Process management commands

Commands in this section apply to working with processes running on a Linux computer.

=== &&

`<command> && <command>`

Executes commands in a sequence.

*Example:*

The following command changes the current directory to `/etc`, then executes the command `ls` to list the contents of the directory:

```
$ cd /etc && ls
```

=== kill

`kill <process_id>`

Removes a running process from memory.

*Example:*

The following example removes the process with the ID of `10` (`$` is the command-line prompt symbol):

```
$ kill 10
```

=== ps

`ps [options]`

Displays the status of the current processes.

*Example:*

The following example invokes the `ps` command with the options `aux` to display every process on the system. The result of the invocation is piped to the `more` command using the `-10` to display the first 10 lines of results for stdout:

```
$ ps aux | more -10
USER         PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
